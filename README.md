# App Service Builder: Node.js HTTP sample

A dependency-free Node.js 24 web app for learning the App Service Builder
GitHub-source workflow. This repository contains one independently usable
sample: the app and `builder.yaml` are at the repository root. No other sample
repository, archive, npm CLI package, or external service is required.

**App Service Builder is in Private Preview. Use this sample for development
and testing, not production.** Live qualification of this sample is pending:
local checks do not establish successful cloud builds, runtime startup, source
authorization, or preview availability. Use a subscription and location enabled
for your preview access; this sample does not promise availability in any region.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **24.x** and its bundled npm, Git, and curl for the local commands.
- For deployment, Azure preview access, an authorized subscription and resource
  group, and a GitHub account that can create a fork and authorize it as a source.
- Port **8080** must be available locally. The server binds `0.0.0.0:8080`;
  do not expose the development server on an untrusted network.

## Run locally

Fork [Azure-Samples/app-service-builder-nodejs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-builder-nodejs/fork)
into your GitHub account, then replace `<your-github-account>`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/app-service-builder-nodejs.git
cd app-service-builder-nodejs
npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org --ignore-scripts
node --check server.mjs
npm test
node server.mjs
```

The lockfile records an empty dependency graph; `npm ci` installs no third-party
packages. The checks use Node's built-in test runner and start and stop their own
server on OS-assigned ports, without using port 8080. Leave the final command
running and use a second terminal:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8080/
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
curl -i http://localhost:8080/not-found
```

| Path | Status | Plain-text body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | 200 | `App Service Builder / nodejs-web: Hello` |
| `/health` | 200 | `OK` |
| Any unknown path | 404 | `Not found` |

Responses end with a newline. Stop the server with **Ctrl+C** before running
tests again or starting another instance.

## Deploy your fork with Portal

See the [App Service Builder documentation](https://builderapps.azure.com/docs/)
and [Portal quickstart](https://builderapps.azure.com/docs/quickstarts/portal/)
for the current preview onboarding and deployment steps. This README describes
the source configuration, not a live-verified cloud deployment.

1. Open [App Service Builder Portal](https://builderapps.azure.com/) and sign in
   with the account enabled for your Private Preview. Create an app in your
   authorized subscription, resource group, and preview-enabled location.
2. Authorize GitHub source access to **your fork**, including access for the
   GitHub organization if applicable. Follow the source authorization flow in
   Portal; do not paste tokens or credentials into source files.
3. Select `<your-github-account>/app-service-builder-nodejs`, branch **`main`**,
   and the **repository root** as the app source. `builder.yaml`, `package.json`,
   `package-lock.json`, and `server.mjs` must all be at that root; do not select
   `samples/nodejs-web` or another subdirectory.
4. Start deployment and wait until Portal reports successful completion. A saved
   source connection alone does not establish that the app is running.
5. Copy the runtime URL shown for the app. Replace `<app-runtime-url>` below with
   that URL (without a trailing slash), then check the greeting and health:

```sh
curl -i "<app-runtime-url>/"
curl -i "<app-runtime-url>/health"
```

Both should return HTTP **200**, with the same bodies as the local default
responses. If deployment fails, use Portal's deployment status and logs before
trying again; a local pass does not qualify the cloud runtime.

### Build and startup contract

`builder.yaml` declares one web component using platform `nodejs`, version
`"24"`, startup command `node server.mjs`, and health check path `/health`.
It omits the single-component defaults: root mount `/`, port `8080`, and
exact health status `200`. There is no custom build or `output` field. Keep
the package and lockfile together, and retain the Node.js 24 engine requirement.

The platform's compute build prepares the runnable app; the startup command is
relative to the selected app root. See
[runtime requirements](https://builderapps.azure.com/docs/reference/runtimes/)
for the preview contract. The GitHub Actions workflow only validates the sample;
it does **not** deploy to Azure.

## Change the public greeting

`SAMPLE_GREETING` is deliberately **public text**, not a secret. The app reflects
only this setting, not the rest of the environment. An unset or empty value uses
`Hello`. With no other instance running:

```sh
SAMPLE_GREETING="Welcome" node server.mjs
```

In a second terminal, `curl -i http://localhost:8080/` should return
`App Service Builder / nodejs-web: Welcome`. `/health` remains `OK`. Stop the
server with **Ctrl+C**.

For a deployed app, add `SAMPLE_GREETING` in Portal **Variables**.
**Save only** persists desired values without changing the running version;
**Save and deploy** captures them in a new version. If you chose Save only,
explicitly deploy a new version before verifying the greeting. Activating a
retained version uses its historical values. Do not override reserved `PORT`.
See the [variables guide](https://builderapps.azure.com/docs/guides/variables/).

## Push an update and explicitly redeploy

Make changes in your fork and get them onto the configured `main` branch, for
example by merging your own pull request. For a direct update to your fork's
`main`, run from this repository with the local server stopped:

```sh
git switch main
npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org --ignore-scripts
node --check server.mjs
npm test
git add server.mjs
git commit -m "Update sample greeting"
git push origin main
```

The example stages a change to `server.mjs`; stage other intended app files if
you changed them. Pushing source does not by itself confirm a deployment. In
Portal, explicitly deploy from the configured fork and `main` branch, wait for
successful completion, then check `/` and `/health` on the runtime URL again.
Uncommitted or unpushed local changes are not uploaded.

## Cleanup

Stop any local server with **Ctrl+C**. In Portal, delete **only the sample app**
and confirm the app deletion; wait for completion. Do not delete a shared
resource group, subscription, fork, or unrelated resources. App deletion does
not remove your GitHub repository or separately created resources.
